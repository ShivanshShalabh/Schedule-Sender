# PortalPass
A Python bot that simplifies the process of accessing and distributing meeting links for online classes. By logging into the school's SRM portal, the bot is able to fetch the links and send them via email to all students in the relevant class. This tool has saved time and eliminated the need for manual login and server navigation, and it has also helped to reduce the server load that previously caused frequent crashes and delays in online meetings.

Languages/ Technologies:
Python, Pytesseract, Selenium, Smtplib
